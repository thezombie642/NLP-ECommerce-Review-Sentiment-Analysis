If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\\n\\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\\n\\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\\n\\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\\n\\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\\n\\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.\", 'summary': 'My current favorite go-to guide for inspiration', 'unixReviewTime': 1439337600}\n {'overall': 4.0, 'vote': '3', 'verified': True, 'reviewTime': '04 5, 2015', 'reviewerID': 'A278N8QX9TY2OS', 'asin': '0449819906', 'style': {'Format:': ' Paperback'}, 'reviewerName': 'Just us', 'reviewText': 'Great book but the index is terrible.

Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don\\'t make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.\\n\\nAll patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, \"how to do basic stitches,\" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It\\'s part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.\\n\\nIf you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I\\'ve not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can\\'t leave an entire sticky notepad\\'s worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that\\'s what I\\'ve done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts.

Have those been published lately? No.\\n\\nIt has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I\\'ve taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna\\'s class-and I haven\\'t looked back.\\n\\nDonna\\'s book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.\\n\\nDonna splits the book into seven different sections:\\n\\n  * Polymer Clay Basics\\n  * Mica Shift Techniques\\n  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay\\n  * Creating Texture\\n  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders\\n  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays\\n  * Sculpture and Mold Making\\n\\nI love Donna\\'s techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It\\'s something I never considered, but it makes great sense.\\n\\nThe twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.\\n\\nPeppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay\\'s artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my \"Donnelly\\'s Sampler\" is included in the book.\\n\\nThis is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\\n\\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\\n\\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\\n6.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer\\'s thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here\\'s my quick start guide:\\n\\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you\\'re screwed.\\n5. Read #4 again.\\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\\n9.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\\n\\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\\n\\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\\n\\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\\n\\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\\n\\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\\n\\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\\n\\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\\n\\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\\n\\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\\n\\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\\n\\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\\n\\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\\n\\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

I personally find it hard to accept why woman would just walk away and keep the baby a secret from the father even if he had wrong her, but that\\'s just my personal opinion. Still, this story, while polished, just didn\\'t grab me.\\n\\nBrice Henderson broke away from his controlling father to make his own fortune, by sacrificing everything, including the one woman he loved, but he can afford no distractions. When his personal assistant needed to take sick leave to take care of family, Brice reluctantly agreed to hire a temporary replacement... who turned out to be the one woman he pushed away... Lena Razzi. Lena spent years trying to forget Brice, despite having a daily reminder... a son by Brice that not even Brice knew about. Lena needed the job, even if it\\'s just a temporary gig, to take care of the baby and herself, and Brice hasn\\'t changed. But as they spent more time together, neither can forget the good times they once had. Can Lena tell Brice about their son if she\\'s not staying? Can they rekindle their love... Or was this going to be a flash in the pan like last time?\\n\\nFrankly, I am tired of books that tout doormat single mom keeping the baby secret as if to spite the (bleep) dad just to prove you don\\'t mean anything to me except as sperm donor, but as soon as they see each other, they got back together. It\\'s basically formula that she won\\'t tell him, believing this second time is temporary as well, then he found out and was pissed off, or he think he\\'s damaged and was too good for her, or vice versa...

Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.\\n\\nAs a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.\\n\\nI would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.\\n\\n==================================================================\\n\\nWow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!\\n\\nI am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!\\n\\nIntuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!\\n\\nYou want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!\\n\\nThe graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.\\n\\nSuch a shame, such a shame.

What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don\\'t confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn\\'t seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There\\'s no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn\\'t hard to do hand to hand. It wasn\\'t 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\\nCons:\\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn\\'t bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\\n(Minor Spoiler) Don\\'t read if you can\\'t take hints.\\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\\n\\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can\\'t even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game.

Fair\\n\\nMr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn\\'t but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\\n\\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron\\'s crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow\\'s nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples\\' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\\n\\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \"the delightful Senora Cool\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25).

It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.\\n\\nIt's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it.

For as long as she can remember, Taylor has loved movies. The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor.

Taylor\\'s too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss\\'s popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It\\'s not about being mean. It\\'s about being confident. Not taking anyone\\'s @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you\\'re quiet, you\\'re invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant. Taking Quinn\\'s advice, Taylor wins victories against Kylie.\\n\\nAs Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up.

Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I\\'m inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn\\'t put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.\\n\\nOverall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.\\n\\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.\\n\\nCourtesy of Hatchette Books Group.', 'summary': 'Fun, satisfying, summer read - would be hilarous movie!', 'unixReviewTime': 1248739200}\n {'overall': 2.0, 'vote': '12', 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '04 14, 2014', 'reviewerID': 'A3J3BRHTDRFJ2G', 'asin': '0511189877', 'reviewerName': 'EJ Honda', 'reviewText': \"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.

The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\\n\\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\\n\\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\\n\\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don\\'t like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\\n\\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn\\'t bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one\\'s perspective.\\n\\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don\\'t know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don\\'t know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\\n\\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don\\'t necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It\\'s all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.', 'summary': 'Give Me the Details', 'unixReviewTime': 1142380800}\n {'overall': 4.0, 'vote': '2', 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '09 24, 2007', 'reviewerID': 'A3JPFWKS83R49V', 'asin': 'B00005N7P0', 'reviewerName': 'Bryan Carey', 'reviewText': \"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\\n\\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\\n\\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\\n\\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.\", 'summary': 'Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment', 'unixReviewTime': 1190592000}\n {'overall': 1.0, 'vote': '5', 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '03 9, 2004', 'reviewerID': 'A5RHZE7B8SV5Q', 'asin': 'B00005N7P0', 'reviewerName': 'gorillazfan249', 'reviewText': \"Maximum PC's slogan is Maximum PC.

Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.

Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\\n\\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\\n\\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\\n\\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.\", 'summary': 'Works well if you place phone in horizontally (landscape mode).

I\\'m writing this nearly four years later.\\n\\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn\\'t have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you\\'re going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\\n\\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It\\'s kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it\\'s part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there\\'s nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they\\'re a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don\\'t have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\\n\\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They\\'re fun!\\n\\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it\\'s not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you\\'ve been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you\\'ve probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It\\'s a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you\\'re likely to need.\\n\\nIn all, it\\'s an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon\\'s discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.\\n\\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they\\'re $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It\\'s really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can\\'t hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she\\'s very pleasant to listen to).\\n\\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it\\'s a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby.

I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son\\'s 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\\n\\nMy Review:\\n\\n1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\\n\\n2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\\n\\nSo, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\\n\\n2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\\n\\n3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\\n\\n4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\\n\\n5. The DVD\\'s and CD\\'s: I have not tried the DVD and CD\\'s yet but the DVD\\'s I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\\n\\nOverall. This is a great price for the package.', 'summary': 'Great Package.

Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\\n\\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn\\'t have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.

It comes in a myriad of colors, so if you are looking for something battle-solid, funky and kid-friendly, the Dolphin with Aquila strings has it all.\\n\\nIf you want to save money, this still is a good deal, but I suggest you change the strings to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aquila-Strings/dp/B003NJF1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings</a>&nbsp;no matter what spare strings come with it. This is a soprano, by the way, so when buying strings, that\\'s the size to look for. Aquilas are made of a nylon that makes a loud, rich sound and they are known for bringing out the sound of even poorer quality instruments. And you need a tuner--the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Snark-Tuner/dp/B003VWKPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Snark Tuner</a>is not expensive and can be used on other types of instruments as well (guitar, etc.)\\n\\nThis was a good deal at under thirty simoleons, but if you are really serious to learn uke or want your kids to learn, the setup I mentioned may keep them interested longer. The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it\\'s more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\\n\\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\\n\\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You\\'ll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better.

Within 2 days of MAYBE 5 minutes per day of me explaining how the clock worked, he could tell time to the exact MINUTE and get it perfectly right every time!\\n\\nMy boy is CRAZY about gears and the fact that this clock has two internal gears showing through a clear window grabbed his eyes and riveted his attention the second he saw it. He immediately wrestled the clock from my hands to play with it. Since playing is learning, I let him have it. The hands are cleverly geared to where the hour hand will advance when the minute hand is turned but the hands are not \"locked\" so you can move the minute and hour hand to wherever you want them to be. This is VERY helpful when you are first teaching time. I could place the hour hand EXACTLY on 12 and the minute hand EXACTLY on the 6 to help him identify 12:30. With other clocks the hour & minute hands lock so when the minute hand is on the half hour, the hour hand is between the 12 and 1 and it won\\'t let you move it forwards or back. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this clock does not lock like that and lets me move the hands completely independently or in tandem as I choose! Sure, he can see that when he moves the minute hand, the hour progresses on its own towards the next hour number and NOW he understands how to read a clock when the hour hand is halfway between two numbers but before he was confused by the hand being between the 12 and 1 and would guess at the time (sixty o\\'five?)\\n\\nAnother thing I love about this clock is that around the outside edge of the numbers is a blue painted \"gear\" circle shape (shown as a green outer ring in the preview) that has the five minute increments written beside every number and the \"teeth\" of the gear mark the individual minutes in between each 5 minute number. He latched on to the gear concept instantly so explaining to him that each gear tooth represented one minute made learning to tell time a SNAP. Literally, I explained the very basics and as he played with the clock, he got it. Easiest thing I have EVER taught him thanks to this little Judy clock!\\n\\nIf you feel like maybe you can\\'t put your understanding of telling time into words, don\\'t worry! The little booklet that comes with the clock gives you step-by-step teaching sentences you can repeat to your child and even covers what \\'quarter hour\\' means. The booklet is about 5x7 inches with some small coloring pages, a few short question worksheets and time telling challenges, etc. I started to use the booklet and got to the part about where I explain quarter hours (the clock is like a pizza and you can slice the time into 4 equal parts of 15 minutes each) and my son was hushing me up because he suddenly understood telling time and wanted to make the clock read the same time as our digital microwave clock. This was in the first five minutes of the thing being in his hands and he did it!\\n\\nIf you have a child who is a tactile-kinesthetic learner, has had difficulty telling time or you just want to make homework a million times easier, get this clock! (And I suggest this style - \\'My Own Little Judy Clock\\' that has non-locking hands). Confusing homework sheets with bland black-and-white clock images become soooo much easier to understand when your child can hold a clock, move the hands around, count by fives along the outer minute rim or count the individual teeth if necessary to answer math questions. If only all of teaching was this easy!\\n\\nClock is yellow plastic with plastic hands and internal gears. It isn\\'t flimsy but could crack if stepped on. Hands are not brittle and have some give to them, which is nice because they get much more handling. 5 inches tall by 5 inches wide with little plastic easel stand in the back for upright display.

Yes, it was a good song with \"If We Are The Body\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her,\" but with \"What This World Needs,\" it\\'s just gotten old now.

It wasn\\'t Mark Hall\\'s voice, the band\\'s music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that \"Voice of Truth\" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.\\n\\nI really like the way that Casting Crowns\\' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the \\'gray area\\' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...\\'no way!\\'. We give God a list that says I\\'ll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don\\'t step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.\\n\\nThe first song on the album: \"What This World Needs\" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.\\n\\nSong #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we\\'ve done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.\\n\\n#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.\\n\\n#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn\\'t giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I\\'m the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )\\n\\n#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.\\n\\n#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. \"The Altar and the Door\" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.\\n\\n#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my \"anthem\". I admire Mark\\'s clever word play- \"Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is...\" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.\\n\\n#8: I Know You\\'re There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.\\n\\n#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.\\n\\n#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.\\n\\n#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.\\n\\nI highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world.

And their third project should continue the trend.\\n\\nThe group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There\\'s nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.\\n\\nThe disc starts off with the rock anthem \"What This World Needs.\"  Think \"If We are the Body\" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.\\n\\nThe title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I\\'ll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it\\'s rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, \"Somewhere in the Middle.\"  In fact, the phrase \"between the altar and the door\" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.\\n\\nAs with other Casting Crown\\'s CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don\\'t grab me.  There\\'s nothing wrong with \"I Know You\\'re There\" and \"All Because of Jesus,\" but they aren\\'t as special as some of their other tracks.\\n\\nMy two favorite songs are back to back.  \"Slow Fade\" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It\\'s a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall\\'s daughter singing \"Because Little Eyes.\"  It\\'s enough to give me chills.\\n\\nAppropriately enough, the next song is \"East to West.\"  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God\\'s forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.\\n\\nMusically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that\\'s just fine because their music is wonderful.\\n\\nI\\'m surprised I haven\\'t worn out Casting Crown\\'s first two releases I\\'ve listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.', 'summary': 'Another Great Release', 'unixReviewTime': 1189036800}\n {'overall': 5.0, 'verified': True, 'reviewTime': '12 7, 2017', 'reviewerID': 'A1XL1WKRIGSTGE', 'asin': '5559166928', 'style': {'Format:': ' Audio CD'}, 'reviewerName': 'bluebird54', 'reviewText': 'Elvis is still the best!', 'summary': 'Five Stars', 'unixReviewTime': 1512604800}\n {'overall': 5.0, 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '09 25, 2016', 'reviewerID': 'A2WC24DWP57F8K', 'asin': '5559166928', 'style': {'Format:': ' Audio CD'}, 'reviewerName': 'Earl', 'reviewText': 'Great cd.', 'summary': 'Five Stars', 'unixReviewTime': 1474761600}\n {'overall': 5.0, 'verified': True, 'reviewTime': '05 15, 2016', 'reviewerID': 'A2OOQPH4D33DLM', 'asin': '5559166928', 'style': {'Format:': ' Audio CD'}, 'reviewerName': 'Pathfinder', 'reviewText': 'Outstanding!!', 'summary': 'Outstanding!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1463270400}\n {'overall': 5.0, 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '01 19, 2016', 'reviewerID': 'A3D697C8E7O03V', 'asin': '5559166928', 'style': {'Format:': ' Audio CD'}, 'reviewerName': 'J.

Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.\\n\\nThe Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.\\n\\nAll in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon.
